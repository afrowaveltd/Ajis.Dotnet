"This is a very long string that contains many characters and is designed to test the parser's ability to handle long strings without any issues. It includes various punctuation marks, numbers like 12345, and special characters like @#$%^&*(). The string continues for quite a while to ensure that buffer handling and memory management are working correctly in the lexer implementation."
